Real-Time Face Detection Application
<br>
Overview
<br>
This project demonstrates a real-time face detection application using OpenCV and the Haar Cascade Classifier. The application captures video from the default camera and detects faces in the video feed, highlighting them with rectangles.
<br>
Features
<Br>
Live Camera Feed: Utilizes the computer's camera to detect faces in real-time.
<br>
Haar Cascade Classifier: Implements advanced face detection using pre-trained classifiers.
<br>
Interactive Visual Feedback: Draws dynamic rectangles around detected faces for immediate visual feedback.
<br>
Optimized Performance: Ensures swift processing and accurate detection with minimal latency.
<br>
Prerequisites
<br>
Python 3.x
<br>
OpenCV library
