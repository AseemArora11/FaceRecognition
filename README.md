<h1>Real-Time Face Detection Application</h1>
<br>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<br>
This project demonstrates a real-time face detection application using OpenCV and the Haar Cascade Classifier. The application captures video from the default camera and detects faces in the video feed, highlighting them with rectangles.
